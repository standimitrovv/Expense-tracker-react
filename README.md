# About the project

This is a copy of the first expense tracker that I've made but this time its done with React js. Just a quick little project made with React, Material UI and Redux.
You have to enter a text that should be of type text and a amount of type number and add the transaction by clicking on the button. It will be rendered on the page as a list item below the History tab. The amounts will be filtered and placed in different categories (Income and Expense). Finally you will see your Total Balance.
